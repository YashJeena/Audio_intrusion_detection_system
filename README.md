Internet security has become an issue for enterprises in the modern world. Since a long time 
ago, Web Firewalls, encryption, authentication, and Virtual Private Networks (VPN) have been 
used to secure network infrastructure and internet communication in the process of protecting 
data. A very recent addition to the category of security technology is audio intrusion detection.
Entering a secure audio environment without authorization is known as audio intrusion. 
Without the intended recipient(s)' knowledge or consent, it entails the act of intercepting, 
watching, or modifying audio signals. A variety of activities, including espionage, 
eavesdropping, sabotage, and the theft of private information, can be carried out through audio 
intrusion. Particularly in sensitive sectors like government, banking, healthcare, and 
technology, it poses a severe danger to privacy and security


# Abstract
An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a device or software programme that keeps track of 
system or network activity and looks for signs of hostile activity. Concerns regarding how to 
safely share and protect digital information are raised by the internet's phenomenal expansion 
and usage. In the modern world, hackers employ a variety of techniques to obtain valuable 
information. One of these is audio intrusion, which refers to the unauthorised introduction of 
sound or music into a secured space, such as a home or business, with the goal to harm or steal. 
Our objective is to implement an audio intrusion detection system to identify suspicious sounds 
and analyse audio patterns to identify potential security breaches. Deep learning technique is 
used to detect the intrusion in our project. This technology is advantageous over conventional 
methods as it can pick up sounds that cameras or other sensors might miss, including those 
coming from closed doors or windows.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, deep learning-based audio intrusion detection systems have demonstrated 
promising results in precisely identifying and categorizing various forms of audio intrusions. 
To accurately classify audio samples, convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural 
networks have been proven to be useful for capturing their temporal and spectral features. 
Additionally, even with scant training data, model performance has been demonstrated to be 
improved by the application of transfer learning and data augmentation techniques.
However, there are still some challenges to be addressed in the development and 
implementation of audio intrusion detection systems. These include the need for large 
amounts of labeled training data, robustness to environmental noise and variability, and 
potential privacy concerns. Future research can focus on addressing these challenges and 
further improving the accuracy and effectiveness of audio intrusion detection systems using 
deep learning methodologies
